# TIME WARP

A minimalist web app that tests your perception of time.

## About

Time Warp is a simple yet fascinating test of how you perceive the passage of time. The concept is straightforward: try to stop the timer exactly at 10 seconds without counting. The results reveal whether your internal clock runs faster or slower than actual time.

## Features

- Clean, minimalist design with a focus on user experience
- Beautiful clock visualization
- Fun result categories based on your time perception
- Shareable results
- Mobile-friendly interface

## Live Demo

You can try the live application here: [Time Warp](https://same-9wmu659t8xr-latest.netlify.app)

## Technology Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

## Local Development

To run this project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/galitsky94/timewarp.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd timewarp

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server
bun run dev
```

## How It Works

1. Users are presented with a minimalist clock face and the question "Is your mind faster than time?"
2. Upon pressing START, they watch a subtle animation of a clock hand
3. When they believe 10 seconds have passed, they press STOP
4. Results show how close they were to the actual 10-second mark
5. Users receive a category label based on their time perception (e.g., "Time Master", "Time Rusher")
6. Results can be shared on social media
